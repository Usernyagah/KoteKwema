  name: string;            // Required
  role: string;            // Required

  phone?: string;          // Optional
  bio?: string;            // Optional
  imageUrl?: string;       // Optional - URL to team member's photo
  order?: number;          // Optional - for sorting (lower numbers appear first)
  createdAt: Date;         // Auto-generated
  updatedAt?: Date;        // Auto-generated on updates
}
```

## Firebase Setup

Ensure your Firebase project has Firestore enabled. The `teamMembers` collection will be created automatically when you add your first team member.

### Security Rules (Recommended)

Add these rules to your Firestore security rules:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Team Members - read by all, write by authenticated admins only
    match /teamMembers/{memberId} {
      allow read: if true;
      allow write: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```
